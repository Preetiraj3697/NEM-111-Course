## MongoDB

MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support for JSON-like storage. The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.

Below is an example of a JSON-like document in a MongoDB database:

```JSON
{
  company_name: "ACME Limited Foodstuffs",
  address: {street: "1212 Main Street", city: "Springfield"},
  phone_number: "1-800-0000",
  industry: ["food processing", "appliances"]
  type: "private",
  number_of_employees: 987
}
```

|Milk   |  1kg    |
|Rice   |  2kg    |
|Shoes  |   2pair |
